# Dev Tools Guild launch

_**TLDR**: Dev Tools Guild unites Ethereum developer tool projects to collectively fund individual members & projects, connect app & protocol developers and boost coordination. Coordinated by Conor Svensson (Founder) and Andrew B Coathup, the guild starts today with a one-year pilot._

**Accelerate Ethereum app development through world-class tooling.**

Dev Tools Guild is a coordinated initiative uniting the teams behind many of Ethereum’s most widely used developer tools. Whether you're writing smart contracts, building trading bots, or deploying consumer apps, chances are you’re relying on infrastructure maintained by guild members.

## Why a Guild

Foundational developer tools are at times underfunded, siloed, or disconnected from protocol development. The Dev Tools Guild exists to raise the tide by **improving alignment, increasing visibility, and ensuring long-term sustainability across the ecosystem**.

Our goals:

* **Fund critical infrastructure**. Many of the tools developers rely on are built and maintained by small, focused teams or a single individual. The guild exists to ensure that foundational work is sustainably supported and aligned with Ethereum’s long-term growth.  
* **Connect app developers to core protocol discussions**. The guild works to bridge the gap between core protocol development and the application layer, helping app developers stay informed about upcoming protocol changes that may affect them, and surfacing developer sentiment to protocol contributors when it can help guide decision-making.  
* **Increase coordination and accountability**. The guild facilitates coordination across tooling teams by enabling visibility into roadmaps, encouraging cross-project knowledge sharing, and providing funders and the community with a clearer signal of where meaningful progress is being made.

## Who’s Involved

The guild is kicking off a one-year pilot to align efforts, test ideas, and build a stronger foundation for the future. Participating individuals & projects maintain core dev tools across the stack:

* **Smart contract languages** – [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) & [Vyper](https://vyperlang.org/)  
* **Client libraries** – [alloy](https://alloy.rs/), [ethers.js](https://ethers.org/), [Nethereum](https://nethereum.com/), [viem](https://viem.sh/), [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/) & [Web3j](https://docs.web3j.io/)  
* **Frameworks and developer environments** – [Ape](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/quickstart.html), [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) & [Scaffold-ETH](https://scaffoldeth.io/)  
* **Standardization tooling** – [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev/)

These projects support critical parts of Ethereum’s developer ecosystem and this pilot is a step toward deeper coordination and long-term impact.

## Guild Coordinators

The Dev Tools Guild aspires to be both an open-source funding mechanism and serve a collaboration function within the ecosystem. Neither are possible without dedicated coordinators. Meet our two Guild Coordinators for the pilot:

#### Conor Svensson

Conor is the founding Guild Coordinator and has been working in a variety of roles for the past year to establish the guild. He was inspired by [Trent](https://x.com/trent_vanepps)’s work creating the [Protocol Guild](https://www.protocolguild.org/) as a collective funding mechanism for the Ethereum protocol.

In 2016 he authored the [Web3j](https://github.com/LFDT-web3j/web3j) Java and Android integration library for Ethereum, and the challenges he experienced with sustaining the project have been a key motivation for his work on the guild.  In addition to the guild, he is working on improving UX and security in Ethereum via the [Enscribe](https://www.enscribe.xyz/) smart contract naming service, which he founded along with [Web3 Labs](https://www.web3labs.com/).

Reach out to [Conor](https://x.com/ConorSvensson) if you’d like to financially support the Guild, or have any other questions.

#### Andrew B Coathup

Andrew recently joined as our second Guild Coordinator.  As part of the role he will keep app developers informed of tooling & protocol updates and surface app developer sentiment to core devs.

He follows Ethereum protocol development and has a passion for sustainable open source software & education.  He is a moderator of Eth Magicians, a member of Optimism’s Citizens’ House and was previously the editor of Week in Ethereum News, and community manager at OpenZeppelin.

Reach out to [Andrew](https://x.com/abcoathup) if you are:

* An app dev that wants to weigh in on an upcoming protocol change, raise a tooling pain point, or highlight a success story  
* A core dev or researcher that wants app or tooling developer feedback

## What's Next

Over the coming months, the guild will:

* **Be a resource to app developers** by publishing the latest tooling and protocol updates that impact Ethereum app development  
* **Be a resource to Ethereum core devs and researchers** by surfacing app developer sentiment when it can best inform roadmap decisions  
* **Be a resource to member projects** by keeping the lights on and providing a venue for transparency and collaboration

If you’re ready to assist us in this mission, reach out to our Guild Coordinators.
