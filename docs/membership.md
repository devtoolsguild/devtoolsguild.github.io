# Membership

## Pilot 1

In Pilot 1, a 12-month experiment, each qualifying project is given one membership allocation per core contributor. Each project is also granted one membership allocation to support unique project needs (e.g., audits, hosting, hardware, bounties), which can be utilized at the project's discretion.
