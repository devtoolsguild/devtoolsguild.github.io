# Introduction

Dev Tools Guild unites Ethereum developer tool projects to collectively fund members and projects, and boost coordination between protocol and dev tools developers.  

Coordinated by [Conor Svensson](https://x.com/ConorSvensson) (Founder) and [Andrew B Coathup](https://x.com/abcoathup), this site explains the *what, why and how* of the Dev Tools Guild.

## Mission

Accelerate Ethereum app development through world-class tooling.

## Why a Guild?

Foundational developer tools are at times underfunded, siloed, or disconnected from protocol development. The Dev Tools Guild exists to raise the tide by **improving alignment, increasing visibility, and ensuring long-term sustainability across the ecosystem.**

Our goals:
* **Fund critical infrastructure**. Many of the tools developers rely on are built and maintained by small, focused teams or a single individual. The guild exists to ensure that foundational work is sustainably supported and aligned with Ethereumâ€™s long-term growth.
* **Connect app developers to core protocol discussions**. The guild works to bridge the gap between core protocol development and the application layer, helping app developers stay informed about upcoming protocol changes that may affect them, and surfacing developer sentiment to protocol contributors when it can help guide decision-making.
* **Increase coordination and accountability**. The guild facilitates coordination across tooling teams by enabling visibility into roadmaps, encouraging cross-project knowledge sharing, and providing funders and the community with a clearer signal of where meaningful progress is being made.
